# Welcome to Your New Workspace!

Hello there! We're excited to have you on board. This is your brand-new environment for creating and experimenting with your own prompts. Below are a few **quick tips** to help you get started:

1. **Explore**  
Feel free to create multiple folders and prompts for different projects or ideas. Organize them in a way that makes sense to you.

2. **Connect to your repo**  
You can connect your prompt folder to your GitHub repository and commit your prompts in a synchronized manner, which provides a faster workflow.

4. **Create rules for Cursor**
You can create rules for Cursor and make your AI outcome much smarter.

5. **Experiment**  
Each prompt can be as simple or as complex as you'd like! Try adding code snippets, bullet points, or references to external links. You can use the AI-TOOL bar below and enhance your prompt.

6. **Collaborate**  
If you choose to share your folder, others can view and learn from your prompts (or you can keep them private just for yourself).

7. **Have Fun**  
Do not be afraid to break thingsâ€”this is your space to learn and grow!

> **Pro Tip**: You can use Markdown to format text, and create headers, lists, or even tables. Have fun exploring all the possibilities!
